# microbitFun
a place to share microbit code

From this github repo
1. Clone this repository

From https://makecode.microbit.org/#
1. click on the "import" button
2. click "import file"
3. click "choose file"
4. navigate to where you cloned this project
5. select the file you want to import to makecode

The Hex folder will contain .hex files that were exported from makecode.microbit.org
Eventually there will be a need to create separate folders for code just for the microbit and code that also requires a robotbit

The folder structure will likely change if I start including the javascript to go along with the .hex files
